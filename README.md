🧠 About Me
I’m Rudraksh Gupta, a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about solving real-world security problems through threat simulation, machine learning, and agentic AI. My interests lie in proactive defense, SIEM optimization, and explainable AI for malware detection. I specialize in combining hands-on technical tools with strategic thinking to deliver high-impact security solutions.

Currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence at the University of Guelph, I am actively building practical, end-to-end solutions that blend threat intelligence, data science, and cloud-native security.

🔐 Featured Projects
CyberSage: Agentic RAG for Threat Intelligence
LLM | Retrieval-Augmented Generation | CVE Analysis | PDF Threat Reports

A cutting-edge RAG-based cybersecurity assistant using Meta’s LLaMA-3 and agent workflows.
Highlights:

Integrated PDF threat intel ingestion and local CVE database querying.

Built vector-based retrieval using FAISS and Sentence Transformers.

Extended the CyberScienceLab RAG_LLM_CVE repo with Streamlit UI and explainable agents.

Tasks include CVE summarization, log file analysis, and report extraction using agentic workflows.

🔧 Tech Stack: LLaMA-3, FAISS, PyPDF, LangChain, Streamlit, JSONL, OpenAI-compatible API

Hybrid Malware Classification
Static + Dynamic Features | XGBoost | SHAP Explainability | CIC-MalMem + EMBER v2

A research-grade malware detection pipeline integrating static (EMBER) and dynamic (CIC-MalMem) features.
Highlights:

Performed large-scale data preprocessing on 850k+ samples across 2,400+ features.

Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and SMOTE for class balancing.

Evaluated MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM models with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Interpreted results using SHAP (summary plots, dependence plots, force plots).

Achieved 96% accuracy with tuned XGBoost.

📊 Tools: Scikit-learn, SHAP, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GridSearchCV

Threat Simulation & SIEM Detection Pipeline
Python | ELK Stack | Sysmon | Suricata | Shodan API
