## 🧠 About Me

I’m Rudraksh Gupta, a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about solving real-world security problems through threat simulation, machine learning, and agentic AI. My interests lie in proactive defense, SIEM optimization, and explainable AI for malware detection. I specialize in combining hands-on technical tools with strategic thinking to deliver high-impact security solutions.

Currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence at the University of Guelph, I am actively building practical, end-to-end solutions that blend threat intelligence, data science, and cloud-native security.
I also represent the **OWASP Student Chapter at the University of Guelph**, where I help drive awareness and education around application security through events, workshops, and student engagement.
